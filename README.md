# Chat Overflow
Chat Overflow is a framework to enable better interaction in livestream events by connecting several inputs and outputs, e.g. chat messages, sub notifications and screen overlays.
The software is developed by three computer science students @ [KIT, Karlsruhe](http://www.kit.edu/) and is headed by [skate702](http://skate702.de). For more information please visit http://codeoverflow.org.

## Chat Overflow API Project
The API Project aims to provide shared methodology for the Chat Overflow plugin framework. Please see the [main project](https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow).
